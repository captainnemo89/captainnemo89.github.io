Best mode of learning is games no doubt about that but there are very minimal games that actually teach about something real.

So the next best option is books. Till 10th we had all round subjects but the teaching was only exam oriented not knowledge oriented but the books were awesome .

In college the subjects are quite limited though you can join clubs and learn about different topics but thats inefficient and unproductive most of the times.

So having a list of some great books that you are going to read is a great way to evolve your worldview.

These books have impacted my world perspective and i refer them whenever I have doubts about the respective topics / subjects.
